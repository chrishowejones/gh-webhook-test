* Listen to Github webhook

  This is a simple Typescript app that will listen to webhooks from github and output messages (and the data payload for
  deployment and webhook job events).

  
** Setup

   To install clone this repo and then run:

   #+begin_src bash
     yarn install
   #+end_src

** Build

   To build this app.

   #+begin_src bash
     yarn tsc
   #+end_src

   
** Run

   To run this app you will need to set up a proxy to direct the Github webhook in your repo to you local machine.

   Install smee client.

   #+begin_src bash
     npm install --global smee-client
   #+end_src

   Or
   
   #+begin_src bash
     yarn global add smee-client
   #+end_src


   Set up a smee proxy URL at https://smee.io/ and set the github webhook in your repo to post to this url for the
   events you're interested in.

   Start the smee client for the URL from above.

   #+begin_src bash
     smee --url https://smee.io/<your url> --path /webhook --port 3000
   #+end_src

   Then you can start the server on port 3000 to listen to the webhook events.


   #+begin_src bash
     yarn start
   #+end_src
